# Implementation questions - should ValueTypes or UserValueTypes be preferred for these kinds of things?
# Pros:
# - ValueTypes don't include a tag, e.g. PleaseTerminate, so are easier to
#   create future versions that extend previous types. e.g. a new key in the
#   dictionary.
# - UserValueTypes do include a tag, so are easier to avoid accidental incorrect
#   use in older versions rather than erroring. Extra code is required for
#   converting between versions but it can be made explicit.
# Cons:
# - ValueTypes need custom code to describe their objects (i.e. being a
#   dictionary is actually several lines to describe). This could be alleviated
#   with factory code to generate ValueTypes.
# - See the opposites of the Pros.
